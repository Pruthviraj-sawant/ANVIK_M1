ANVIK M1 is a multi-agent personal assistant framework built in Node.js.

It is designed to act like a real assistant (like JARVIS, Google Assistant, or GPT-based agents) and is modular, meaning you can add any tool, service, or agent very easily.

Here is the meaning of every folder:

🧠 2. agents/ — The Brain (Multi-Agent System)

This folder contains:

✔ agent.js

Defines a SINGLE agent class.
Each agent has:

name

description

tools it can use

decision-making logic

communication with LLM

Basically the “worker agent”.

✔ agentsOrchestrator.js

This is the boss agent / manager.

It decides:

Which agent should do what

Which tool to call

How to coordinate multiple agents

How to pass results between them

This is what makes M1 more advanced than BASE_AGENT.

✔ index.js

Exports all agents + orchestrator.

🧩 3. core/router.js — Main Routing Engine

This creates the main API routes and connects them to the orchestrator.

Flow:

Frontend → router → agentsOrchestrator → tools → LLM → response


It’s the pipeline controller.

🔧 4. services/ — Tools (Actual Capabilities)

This folder contains all tools the agent can use.

Here are the tools inside:
🗓 calendarTool.js

Helps the agent:

read calendar

add events

schedule reminders

📧 emailTools.js

Basic email operations.

📫 email/findcontacts.js

Finds contact names from mailbox.

📨 email/sendemail.js

Sends emails.

📥 email/reademail.js

Reads inbox.

🧠 aiService.js

The brain.
Talks to the LLM:

sends user prompt

gets AI response

guides agent & orchestrator

📝 notionTool.js

Connects to Notion workspace:

create notes

read pages

update documents

⏰ reminderTool.js

Set reminders
Trigger alerts
Store user reminders

🔌 5. db/connect.js — Database Connection

Connects to MongoDB using Mongoose.

👤 6. models/User.js — User Schema

Includes:

name

email

tokens

preferences

settings

saved reminders

saved tasks

🔐 7. routes/authRoutes.js — Authentication API

Handles:

signup

login

refresh token

logout

🛠 8. utils/llm.js — LLM Interface

This file is responsible for:

calling OpenAI or any LLM

passing the prompt

binding tools

structured outputs

function calling support

This is the core AI bridge.

🟢 9. index.js — Entry Point

Starts the server.

Flow:

Loads env → connects DB → loads router → starts API

🔥 Now, The Most Important Part:
🚀 How ANVIK M1 Actually Works (ENGINE FLOW)

Let’s break down what happens inside when you send:
“Send an email to John saying I will be late.”

Step-by-Step Execution
🟩 Step 1 → Request arrives at API

The frontend hits:

POST /ai


The message goes to router.js.

🟦 Step 2 → Router → Orchestrator

agentsOrchestrator.js analyzes:

user message → “send an email…"

matches required agent → “Email Agent”

matches required tool → “sendemail.js”

🟧 Step 3 → Orchestrator → LLM

LLM receives a structured prompt like:

User wants to send an email:
{
  "task": "send email",
  "to": "John",
  "message": "I will be late"
}


LLM may respond with tool instructions.

🟥 Step 4 → Tool Activation

sendemail.js triggers:

connect to user mailbox

find contact

send email with text

🟨 Step 5 → Tool returns output

Example:

Email sent successfully to John.


This goes back to the orchestrator.

🟪 Step 6 → Orchestrator → LLM Response

The final user-friendly response is generated.

🟩 Step 7 → Back to User

You receive:

“Email successfully sent to John.”

🎯 What Makes ANVIK M1 Powerful?
✔ Multi-agent system
✔ Tool-based architecture
✔ LLM-driven orchestration
✔ Easy to extend
✔ Clear separation of:

AI logic

Tools

Database

User auth

Agents

✔ Perfect foundation for:

Personal digital assistant

AI productivity tools

Jarvis-style system

College / office assistant

Knowledge manager

🏆 In Simple Words:

ANVIK M1 = LLM + Tools + Multi-Agent System + Orchestrator + DB + Auth
All working together to behave like a smart personal assistant.
